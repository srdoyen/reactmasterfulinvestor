      "\tOne of the most challenging aspects of personal finance and saving that often comes up for me is the why component of it all. Why do I care if I save or invest an extra dollar here or there? What am I trying to achieve in the future through my frugality now? Most of the advice you will see on this platform is revolved around       reducing bad debt and unnecessary expenses, so you can invest in your future through long term assets. While I believe every person should be aware of their finances and have some goals with regards to these, I like to balance a fine line between the present and the future with regards to money. Through good habits of saving and investing in the long term, I do believe it is very possible for most people to achieve financial independence, but I think at some point you must know why you are going to great lengths to achieve it.\n\n\tWhile it may seem a long ways out (trust me I know), I believe that life is insufficient without purpose. Maybe at this point you don't know why you want to be financially independent or what you will do ONCE you are financially independent. That's OK. In fact, I am still figuring this out too, but one glaring advantage would include TIME freedom -> to do what you want to do when you want to do it. I am one who believes that work is necessary for a happy, healthy life. For myself personally, I care little about making boatloads of money and being rich. I would rather live a modest lifestyle where my expenses are covered so that I could focus on my true passions in life: family, friends, health, and meaningful work.\n\n\tAlso, I think having an addiction to every penny you spend or invest is not healthy either. Sometimes we work so hard now for something in the future, but it's important to enjoy the process - as the future is not always a guarantee. Many investors encourage roughing it now for the life you want later. In some scenarios that might be true as maybe that is the only option to get yourself out of a difficult financial situation, but for most I think that it just requires some more time spent to budgeting and knowledgeable investing. My recommendations are not to sacrifice the things that are important to you now for some glorified future of financial freedom. What I mean is if you want the financial freedom to spend more time with your family, friends, and health, do not sacrifice all of those things NOW or you are just being hypocritical. In life there is always a balance! For example, instead of going out to dinner, a movie, and ice cream, eat dinner and dessert at home but still go to the movies! Or alternatively, eat out and watch the movie at home! Simple decisions like these will add up over the long term! Thanks for reading!",
